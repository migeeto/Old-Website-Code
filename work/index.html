       <p>Ultimate Package Simulator was a game developed for the Columbia College Chicago Manifest Game Jam.
        My main contribution to this project was in level design, although I also helped a little bit on the programming.
        The theme for the game jam was "living, breathing city", so we made a city full of cars, with plans to add
        pedestrians that never came to fruition. The city from above actually looks like blood vessels, with cars behaving
        as blood in this "living" city. We came in first place with this project.</p>
